(work in progress)

Recently I was writing a simple golden testing framework. A golden testing
framework essentially stores the expected output of a command in a certain
file and when tests are ran, it compares the actual output of the command
to the expected output stored in the file. It's a pretty simple but
effective way of writing both unit tests and end-to-end tests.

I wanted my framework to produce a diff (like a Git diff) of the actual output
and the expected output if a test case fails. So, I had to implement a
diffing algorithm. Thankfully, this was one of the rare occasions where my
numerous hours of grinding LeetCode actually came to save the day.

It's not hard to see that in essence, all a diffing algorithm does is try to
pair up identical lines of text. Then, the lines that weren't paired in the
actual output are "new" or "inserted" and the lines that weren't paired in
the expected output are "old" or "removed." There is an additional constraint
that the sequence of lines paired in each file must come in order. So, we can't
have a pairing (3, 3) and (2, 5). We can't shuffle the lines in
either output.

So our goal is to find a maximal pairing, i.e. try to maximize the number of
pairs. This is a pretty standard dynamic programming problem - we're trying
to find the longest common subsequence.
