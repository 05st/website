I've always dreaded writing for as long as I can remember.
It's not because I think I'm too unimaginative or dull,
or because I think I'm a terrible writer. I'm certainly not a great
writer - but I want to improve. I believe
my aversion to writing stems from the fact that throughout
my life, I wasn't offered a lot of creative freedom in what
I wrote. Throughout
my high school English classes, I was required to write things like
stories, literary analyses, memoirs, and essays, and more. But,
I was often constrained
to writing about topics I frankly cared very little about.
To be able to produce good literature,
you need to be truly passionate about what you are writing - I wasn't,
a majority of the time. Furthermore, I often found
my opinions conflicting with the world view I was expected to demonstrate
in my writing. And on top of that, my work would be graded based on a very
subjective grading scheme. It always felt as if I was writing to satisfy my
teacher, rather than writing to express myself.

With that being said, I am grateful for my high school English classes
because they gave me a reason to write. Perhaps not the most intrinsically motivated reason
(I just wanted to graduate with good grades), but a reason nonetheless.
Now that I'm studying computer science in university, I have very little reason to write
outside of the two mandatory communications courses I have to take. As I entered my
undergraduate studies, I loved the thought of never having to write again. But, I've
come to realize that's not necessarily a good thing. Writing is an essential skill. Practicing it
not only develops your communication skills, it also improves your creativity, and
sharpens your thinking abilities. I want to cultivate my intellectual vitality.

And so, that's why I'm starting this little blog section on my website. So I can
freely express my thoughts, whatever they may be, in a casual manner without
the pressures of ticking all the boxes on a rubric, and without being coerced
into someone else's world view. 

I'll probably write a lot about math and computer science. But expect
anything.
