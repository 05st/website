> And now that you don't have to be perfect, you can be good.

\- John Steinbeck

I've always dreaded writing for as long as I can remember.
It's not because I think I'm too unimaginative or dull,
or because I think I'm a terrible writer. I'm certainly not a great
writer - but I want to improve. I believe
my aversion to writing stems from the fact that throughout
my life, I wasn't offered a lot of creative freedom in what
I wrote. Like a lot of people, throughout
my high school English classes, I was forced to write things like
stories, literary analyses, memoirs, and essays. But, I was often constrained
to writing about topics I frankly cared very little about.
Don't get me wrong, I admire good literature. It's just that
to be able to produce good literature,
you need to be truly passionate about what you are writing and unfortunately,
most of the time in high school, I wasn't.
And on top of that, my work would be graded based on my teacher's
(sometimes quite subjective) opinions. I felt as if I was writing
what I thought my teacher wanted to see, rather than what I actually
wanted to express.

With that being said, I am thankful that my high school English classes gave me a reason
to write. Perhaps not the most intrinsically motivated reason (I just wanted
to graduate with good grades), but a reason nonetheless.
Now that I'm studying computer science in university, outside of the two mandatory
communications courses I have to take, I have very little reason to write.
And that's not necessarily a good thing. Writing develops your
communication skills, improves your creativity, sharpens your thinking abilities,
and cultivates your intellectual vitality.

And so, that's why I'm starting this little blog section on my website. So I can
freely express my thoughts, whatever they may be, in a casual manner without
having to coerce myself to fit into someone's grading scheme.

I'll probably write a lot about computer science, math, and philosophy. But expect
anything.
