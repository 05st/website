> "Do not despise the bottom rungs in the ascent to greatness."

I'd like to preface this (and all my other blog posts, to be honest) by acknowledging that
I'm still young (nineteen at the time of writing this), so a lot of the ideas I share may
appear naive, or inaccurate, or even straight up misinformed. But this is my blog, so I can write whatever
I want. Anyway, here goes.

Something I've been thinking of lately is the concept of success. What does it mean to be
successful? To be rich and find happiness and fulfillment and achieve all your dreams and goals in
life? I believe that one can never truly reach a well-defined state of success. Rather,
success is a never-ending journey of growth and development, where achieving one goal or
solving one problem simply opens you up to a bigger goal or another (but potentially better)
problem. In this perspective, people that appear to be (more) successful can simply be
seen as having achieved more of their goals in life. Unfortunately, we are all born with differences
in abilities and circumstance and opportunities, and as a result some people are simply born into
a state of "more success" that others have to work incredibly hard to reach, and some people may have
an easier time achieving their goals for a variety of reasons. It's important to learn to
live with the cards you were dealt, and rather focus on the things that you *can* change,
and on improving yourself to the best of your abilities. Everybody is struggling through their
own unique, infinitely long ladder of success - but some people are just struggling with
nicer rungs, and the rungs tend to get nicer the higher you go. So, I guess what I'm trying to get
at is, rather than asking "how do I become successful?" a better question to ask may be
"how do I get good at achieving things?" or, "how do I get better at climbing this stupid ladder?"

(work in progress)
