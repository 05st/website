> "Do not despise the bottom rungs in the ascent to greatness."

I'd like to preface this (and all my other blog posts, to be honest) by acknowledging that
I'm still young (nineteen at the time of writing this), so a lot of the ideas I share may
appear naive, or inaccurate, or even straight up misinformed. But this is my blog, so I can write whatever
I want.

What does it mean to be successful? To be rich and find happiness and fulfillment and achieve
all your dreams and goals in life? I believe that one can never truly reach a well-defined
state of success. Rather, success is a never-ending journey of growth and development, where
achieving one goal or solving one problem simply opens you up to a bigger goal or another (but
potentially better) problem. In this perspective, people that appear to be (more) successful
can simply be seen as having achieved more of their goals in life. Unfortunately, we are all
born with differences in abilities and circumstance and opportunities, and as a result some
people are simply born into a state of "more success" that others have to work incredibly
hard to reach, and some people may have an easier time achieving their goals for a variety
of reasons. It's important to learn to live with the cards you were dealt, and rather focus
on the things that you *can* change, and on improving yourself to the best of your abilities.
Everybody is struggling through their own unique, infinitely long ladder of success - but
some people are just struggling with nicer rungs, and the rungs tend to get nicer the higher
you go. So, I guess what I'm trying to get at is, rather than asking "how do I become
successful?" a better question to ask may be "how do I get good at achieving things?" or,
"how do I get better at climbing this stupid ladder?"

Ever since I was young, I've observed that all the people around me that I would look up to,
that have achieved many things, all share a common characteristic. They are incredibly
persistent. As a result, it's also something I've tried very hard for many years to instill
in myself. Someone who is persistent will chip away at something for hours on end with
unwavering commitment and conquer whatever it is they had set their mind to - like learning
a skill. A personal example would be learning guitar. All of the incredible guitarists I
look up to dedicate hours and hours of continuous practicing and make marginal improvements.
Yet, it fills them with complete satisfaction. Despite the marginal improvement becoming
smaller and smaller, they understand that the key factor which differentiates them from
other people is that difference in improvement that they accumulate. Furthermore, this
mindset and methodology can be applied to many other things in life. It's not a coincidence
that many hard-working musicians or skilled athletes also excel academically, and professionally.

Reading over what I've just written, I realize this all sounds a bit cliché. But it's probably
cliché for a reason. And at this point, I will stop writing.
