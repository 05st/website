> "Do not despise the bottom rungs in the ascent to greatness."

I'd like to preface this (and all my other blog posts, to be honest) by acknowledging that
I'm still young (nineteen at the time of writing this), so a lot of the ideas I share may
appear naive, or inaccurate, or even straight up misinformed. But this is my blog, so I can write whatever
I want. Anyway, here goes.

Something I've been thinking of lately is the concept of success. What does it mean to be
successful? To be rich and find happiness and fulfillment and achieve all your dreams and goals in
life? I believe that one can never truly reach a well-defined state of success. Rather,
success is a never-ending journey of growth and development, where achieving one goal or
solving one problem simply opens you up to a bigger goal or another (but potentially better)
problem. In this perspective, people that appear to be (more) successful can simply be
seen as having achieved more of their goals in life. Unfortunately, we are all born with differences
in abilities and circumstance and opportunities, and as a result some people are simply born into
a state of "more success" that others have to work incredibly hard to reach, and some people may have
an easier time achieving their goals for a variety of reasons. It's important to learn to
live with the cards you were dealt, and rather focus on the things that you *can* change,
and on improving yourself to the best of your abilities. Everybody is struggling through their
own unique, infinitely long ladder of success - but some people are just struggling with
nicer rungs, and the rungs tend to get nicer the higher you go. So, I guess what I'm trying to get
at is, rather than asking "how do I become successful?" a better question to ask may be
"how do I get good at achieving things?" or, "how do I get better at climbing this stupid ladder?"

I believe a key characteristic of people who are good at achieving things is that they are incredibly
persistent. Whether it be in sports, or business, or academics, or honestly any other endeavour, someone
who is persistent will chip away at something for hours on end with unwavering commitment and conquer
whatever it is they had set their mind to. People like this are generally hooked onto - even addicted
to - the feeling of improvement. The feeling of making some marginal improvement after practicing
something for a few hours, regardless of how small the level of improvement may be (and the law of diminishing returns applies
here), fills them with complete satisfaction. This is something I can personally relate to as well, and I
truly believe this sort of mentality was instilled in me through learning musical instruments and playing
video games, but it is reinforced by other hobbies as well like going to the gym. Once you put countless
hours into improving at something difficult, you realize that you can apply
the same methodology to everything else in life. It's a bit like
conditioning your mind to enjoy the pain that you go through to make these marginal improvements
because of the rewarding satisfaction you feel in the end. And often, once you do get good at something,
you naturally enjoy doing it more, in a sort of positive feedback loop. Then, you understand that
the biggest hurdle is always the beginning. Now, I'm not trying to paint myself
as some kind of perfect, perpetually improving human being or a pain-enjoying masochist.
World-class athletes or top competitive programmers for example would probably fit that description
a lot more. I can be incredibly lazy sometimes, and I can get distracted too. But, I try to minimize
those things, and I'm constantly trying to get better at it (and that's kind of meta). So, to
summarize: no pain, no gain, bro.

So, this naturally brings us to the question of, "how do I choose what to improve at?" and the
stereotypical reponse to that would be "whatever it is you're passionate about." But to be honest,
I don't believe in that. I honestly believe that you *become* passionate about something
once you get good at it - not the other way around. So, if you already truly have something you
are passionate about and know for certain that pursuing that is what you'd like to base your infinite
ladder of success on, congrats. Otherwise, you have some work to do. Let me talk a bit about myself
first.
